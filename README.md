# Language Cellular Automata

ðŸš€ Coming Soon â€“ end February 2025 / beginning March 2025 ðŸš€

This repository will host the Language-Cellular Automata (Language-CA) framework, aim to study self-organization in artificial systems using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Inspired by neural cellular automata (NCA), Language-CA enables multi-agent simulations where agents perceive, update, and communicate through language-based interactions.
